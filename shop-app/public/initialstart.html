**** Network Notes - Topics - keywords - commands ****

ping (round trip time) - ping /? - ping -n num
tracert -d

internet protocol stack (
physical / bits on the wire -
link / ethernet 802.111wifi PPP -
network / ip routing protocol -
transport / TCP UDP -
application / FTP HTTP SMTP)

hosts = end system and computing devices running network apps

encoding like ascii or unicode
RFC then protocol name to get standard decomentation

TCP initial connect between devices connection via internet

invent network (queue theory) packet switching

modelation and demodelation (modem) electrical signal and digital signal conversion
on the same transmitting media link (multi channel)

DSLAM digital subscriper line access multiplexer (reverse function of splitter) (merging signals)

digital signal has fidilty (can remove noise) but analog not

size / size of packet = transmitting time

router buffer - storing forward

telephone - circuit switching - one connection - no sharing connection
packet switching - multi connection same time - shared connection

processing delay - queuing delay - propagation delay (length of physical link)

routing algorithms

packet drops when memory(router buffer) fills up

queuing delay

bandwidth (physical proprty for lines measured by hertz) =
transimission rate = bit per second (bit/sec)
this is a related with encoding scheme

packet switches (routers - switches) internet edges

***** Apache web server *****

get request data sends within request line
post request data sends within request body (payload)

status codes:
- 1xx informational
- 2xx success
- 3xx redirection
- 4xx client error
- 5xx server error
200 OK - 401 unauthorized - 403 forbidden - 404 not found - 500 internal server error

Apache and web servers cosists of 3 types of files:
1- log files record events and actions on the site (access logs / error logs / custom logs)
2- web files like html css js and any browse files (path: /var/www/html)
3- configuration files consists of two main types:
- global / main / default configuration files (apply on all system)
- directory level to specefic directory

public web files / log files path:
(Ubuntu)
/var/www/html
/var/log/apache2
(CentOS)
/var/www/html
/var/log/httpq

main configuration file
(Ubuntu)
/etc/apache2/apache2.conf
(CentOS)
/etc/httpq/conf/httpq.conf

command apache2 server (sudo service apache2 start/stop/restart)
after any configuration change must restart (sudo service apache2 restart)

directive is a keyword followed by one or more arguments

apache2.conf (<Directory dirpath>
    #configuration directives - write global config directly or
    AllowOverRide all
    #then create .htaccess in project dir and write configurations

    #indicate visitors depends on ip ads
    Allow from IP address
    deny from all
    order deny,allow
</Directory>)

static medule (compiled module) and shared module (run time module)
display cpmpiled modules:
apache2ctl -l (Ubuntu) / httpq -l (CentOS)
list all modules compiled and shared:
apache2ctl -M (Ubuntu) / httpq -m (CentOS)
to enable or deisable module:
sudo a2enmod modulename / sudo a2dismod modulename

apache2.x supports pluggable concurrency models called MPM

MPMs multi-processing modules:

- the worker module:
hypered between multi-process and multi-thread
server larger requests with less resources than process-based server
many threads inside process
disadvantage effect other threads - less stability not accurated - not isolated

- the event module:
as well as worker module but handle larger amount of requests
AsyncRequestWorkerFactor
if all worker are busy will close keep alive state connection

- the prefork module:
non-threaded - not proper to handle too many requests (start/minspare/maxspareservers/maxclients)
advantage - process serve request (isolate each request dosnt effect each other)
disadvantage - processing time will waste on the process switching for requests and processor stress

Rewrite Module:
URL manipulations - one used to migrate apps or systems - redirection
RewriteRule - RewriteCond







thread is a lightweight process (stack - registers - pc)
thread seperated process in the parent process sharing same memory space (isolation)
modules devided server into processes or process into threads
many process effects performance makes it low

**** DevOps Main Pillars - Main Skills ****
Dev (build) / Ops (start stop run ...)
physical server - virtual machine - templates - docker (containers - kernel terminal)
base disk - base image (.vhd/
.avhd-deferancing vhd - has only defferances of vhd and being the parent of vhd)

OS specefications (terminal mode and user mode)
container consists of layers above kernel

cloud infrastructure /
orchastration - kubernates - dockercharm /
containrisation - docker /
integration - jenkis - github /
infrastructure automation - infrastructure as a code - terraform /
configuration managament - ansibl /
monitoring solutions - promissus /
kubernates native - piplines - kubernates AWS /
dasa organization - devops agile associated - dasa princible /
ckad - cert kubernates application development /
SRE - site raibly engineer - google career /
capx - opex /
cloud == infrastructure + orchastration [add and remove services] and automation /
cloud [public - private - hyprid] /
accountability and logs [root - IAM] /
identify federation - auth by trusted account like google acc /
PCI Compliance - credit card information security standard /
IAM long term credintial - STS secure token service (temp session) /
4 methods for AWS [
- username and password (console)
- parogramatic access key
- SD keys (python - nodejs ...) acess key and secrect access key or IAM Rules Temp session
- API's
]

root and important users uses multi factor authantication MFA
virtual private cloud VPC

when create account AWS make default VPC on all of its regions
with basic security and services and DNS and can make own VPC with IP adrs

VPC Components [ CIDR class list interdomain routing block and subnets (ip range in VPC)]

no subnets overlapping at VPC (TCP/IP restrection)

implied router to connect and sync between subnets at deferent VPC
[cant control router its by default but route table]

advanced - before the traffic comes for VPC
(edge associations)[redirect for another security VPC and return]

VGW virtual gateway - VPN in hypred with on-premsis
IGW (internet gateway) and public submit vs private submit
0.0.0.0/0 public entry

routing coponents of vpc
direct connect (high performance) vs vpn and vpn as backup connection
deattach then remove for VGW and IGW

region is physical or geographic area for AWS infrastructure

EC2 vs instance store

elastic compute cloud EC2 (ECC) soft limit = virtual server
hypervisor to emulate many virtual server from one server device
hypervisor (hardware virtualization)
dedicated host and shared host

ENI elastic network interface eth0
EBS elastic block store (volume service) - through network - must same availability zone
to make root volume - boot volume (OS of EC2 instance)
EBS volume is presestance (EBS backed EC2 instance)(EC2 instance depends on EBS volume)

instance store being at the same physical server faster and proformed than EBS
instance store not presestance (IOPS) input output operation per second being very high

using SSH to connect to linux EC2 instance

public key for ssh client and private key for server but at VPC the opposite
must download the key while creating instance

AMI amazon machine image (select OS for EC2)

source (user IP) - distnation (VPC public IP - NAT - private IP)
NAT convert public IP into private IP
PAT port address translation

NACLs vs Security group

security group (firewall on the instance inbound and outbound) stateful

inbound traffic from another instance or from internet throug subnet to my enviroment

NACLs - network access control lists / works at subnet level not instance level / stateless
disadvantage of NCLs - permit for all subnets or deny for all subnets
advantage is defender line for instance (first line of defence) then security group of instance
has its own rule of inbound and outbound not stateful like security group rules

implied router (routing core and brain) connect all subnets in VPC togther
and routing IGW - VGW (internet)

instance inside same subnet then security group rule takes control
outside instance or from internet through implied router then NACLs will control

security group deal with inbound and outbound with same rules and empacts only instances in EC2
NACLs deals with inbound and outbound as different rules for each one and empacts all instances

NACLs confined to VPC
security group checks all rules
but NACLs check from lowest to first rule

instance may has many security group at a time
subnet has only one NACLs at a time
NACLs can associate for many subnets

******* Docker *******
is an open source standalone appliction
which works as an engine used to run containerized applications
run multiple applications isolated
